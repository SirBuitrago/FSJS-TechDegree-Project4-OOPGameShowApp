# TechDegree-Project4-OOPGameShowApp

Game Show Application:

Browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to create and select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Made a few color changes to the elements on the page. This includes...
-background color to the "start game" screen
-background color to the "you lost" screen
-background color to the "you win" screen
-background color to keyboard letters that are chosen "right"
-background color to keyboard letters that are chosen "wrong"
